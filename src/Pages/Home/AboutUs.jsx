                    PetConnect was created to bridge the gap between animals in need and loving families ready to adopt.
                    We believe every pet deserves a second chance at life, and every person deserves the joy of companionship.
                </p>
                <p className=" text-lg">
                    Our platform allows individuals to list pets for adoption, while giving adopters the ability to find their perfect companion easily.
                    From submitting adoption requests to tracking campaigns â€” everything is made simple, safe, and heartfelt.
